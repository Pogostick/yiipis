<h1>On Becoming A Member Of YiiPIS</h1>
<div>
	<p>Just so we can boast to the world that we too have millions of users, we kindly ask that you at least cough up an email address and a name.</p>
	<p>We don't really care about your other personal information. We will not sell your email address or name for fun and profit. We will never spam you. We <b>may</b> send you an occasional email about YiiPIS stuff. However, in the future we want to upgrade the site to add <i>user preferences</i>. At that time, you will be able to opt-out of all system emails. But, in all likelihood, the only email you receive from us will probably be announcing the new <b>User Preferences</b> section.</p>
